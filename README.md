## 📖 **DevStage - Event Registration System**  

This project was developed during **NLW Connect 19**, by **Rocketseat**, in the **Python** track, using **Flask, SQLAlchemy**, and other technologies. It is part of the **DevStage** application, an **API for event registration and management**.  

### 📌 **Features**  

✅ Users register by providing **name and email**.  
✅ A **referral link** is automatically generated.  
✅ Other people **can** sign up using this link, but it is not mandatory.  
✅ The system **stores registrations** in a **SQLite** database.  
✅ If someone registers using the referral link, the user who shared it **earns points**.  
✅ The system **tracks and counts** sign-ups via referrals.
